# HarvardX-PH125.9x-EPL
Machine learning models of English Premiership results.
Submitted as part of requirements for Edx course HarvardX-PH125.9x.

There are several ways to 'run' this project.

## From the R file

Run EPL-Project.R. It will:
* Download all data files (takes about 35 minutes)
* Clean the data
* Run analysis
* Run the machine learning models (takes about 24 hours)

## From Github

All of the data files and rda files created by the R file are also on Github. You can copy these files instead of downloading them or running the machine learning models. To do this, copy the folder structure as is. The folder (and data files) on Github exactly mirror the folder structure the R program creates.
